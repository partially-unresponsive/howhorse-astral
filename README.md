# howhungry.horse

Why did the horse build a road? To get state funding from the Urban Planning Council.

### Features
Features I want implemented throughout the project:
- Minimal boilerplate/copied code and modules
- Proper layout that (mostly) does not reach 'industry standard' quality (as far as I'm concerned)
- Inspired by Userweb with a cozy, minimally invasive aesthetic
- Squircles disallowed: no rounded borders above 15%
- Decently fast and local
- No React
- Maximum amount of cool footer buttons
- LaTeX support(?)


### Potential Uses
- Factorio world visualizer
- Factorio blueprint visualizer (insert string and you get the visualized blueprint)
    - Alternatively, just a blueprint book library (with associated images)
- Factorio calculator (like https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html)
- Obsidian.md **blog** posts
- 3D models visualizer (Three.js)
- Portfolio website
- File sharing server
- 2FA (two factor authentication) server, replacing Authy
- Advent of Code solutions (written in Rust)
- Google Sheets replacement to share spreadsheets of my ratings for multimedia (for example, like it is done in Obsidian)
- Code snippets and local config files
- Goodreads/iMDB alternative
